      <h3>About Me</h3>  
      <p>Hello, my name is Zahrin Hussain. I'm from New York but ethnically I am from Bangladesh. I am attending Dewitt Clinton High School as the Class of 2026. I was born on September 30, 2008 in The Bronx, New York. My current pathway in highschool is Computer Science. The first time I was introduced to Computer Science was 9th grade, my freshman year of highschool. I had no prior knowlegde but I surprisingly got the hang of it very quickly. When I go to college I am hoping to pursue and get a degree in Computer Science. As I finish and go through my highschool career, I hope to grow and get better at coding in hopes to excell.       </p>
