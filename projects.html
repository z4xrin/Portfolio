    <p>This is one of the projects I am very proud of myself for making. In this project, we had to make our own restaurant and create a menu for it using HTML and CSS. We got to choose which meals, appetizers, drinks, desserts and more that would be showcased on our menu. My restaurant was insipried by Bangladesh and China, I named it Bengal Chinese. </p>

    <p>In this project, we had to list our classes in order of our schedule. I included all my classes, along with which teacher teached the class. I also added which room the class took place in. After every class, I added a short description of what to expect in the class.</p>

    <p>Since our Living Enviornment exam was coming up, we decided to make study guides to help us prepare for the test, along with improving our coding skills. We used topics from each unit and explained them thoroughly to get the best understanding of it that we could possibly acheive.  </p>

    <p>This was our classes first ever official project in HTML. We were finally putting our knowledge to the test to see how much we learned. We created our very own website about anything we wanted. I picked my website to be about bread. I used all the things I learned while making this website. </p>
